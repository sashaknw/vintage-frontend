          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            Founded in 2020, Vintage Vault began as a small passion project
            between friends who shared a love for fashion history and
            sustainable clothing. What started as weekend visits to estate sales
            and thrift stores quickly evolved into a curated collection of
            high-quality vintage pieces from across the decades.
          </p>

          <p>
            Today, Vintage Vault is dedicated to preserving the craftsmanship
            and style of bygone eras while promoting sustainable fashion
            practices. Each item in our collection has been carefully selected
            for its quality, condition, and unique character.
          </p>
